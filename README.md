# BuzzOff

Buzz Off is a 2D tower defense Android application where the player controls a beehive that needs to collect honey while fending off animals. It was a term project for my Software Engineering course where we went through the agile software engineering paradigm and created a System Requirements Specification and a System Design Document, and then developed the app in about a month.

How to run: Right-click on the BuzzOff/BuzzOff.apk file and send it to a connected Android device.
